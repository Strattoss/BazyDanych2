# Databases 2
This repository contains exercises done by me during the 4th semester at AGH UST's Database course. The course was supposed to familiarize us with databbase technologies and their real-life usage. The repository covers a range of the most popular database technologies. Each section contains hands-on exercises, sample code, and documentation with practical implementation of these database technologies.

## [Oracle PL/SQL](PL_SQL)
In this directory, you will find exercises related to Oracle's PL/SQL, which is a procedural extension of SQL used for programming within the Oracle Database environment.

## [Entity Framework](EntityFramework)
This section includes exercises related to the Entity Framework, a popular object-relational mapping (ORM) framework used with .NET applications to interact with databases.

## [Hibernate/JPA](Hibernate_JPA)
Here, you can find exercises related to Hibernate and Java Persistence API (JPA). Hibernate is a popular ORM framework for Java applications, while JPA is a standard interface used to manage relational data in Java applications.

## [MongoDB](MongoDB)
This directory covers exercises related to MongoDB, a NoSQL database management system that stores data in JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. This technology is particularly close to my heart, as I spent a lot of time working on a project involving a MongoDB database.
